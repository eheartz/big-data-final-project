Final Project - Big Data Tools and Techniques

This Project leverages Python to import 100k+ rows of data into a NoSLQ Database (Neo4J). It then queries it and exports the results to a csv. Then 3 visualizations are created using Tableau Software. 
This Project was created by Elijah Heartsfield and was made as a Final Project submission for Rowan University's Big Data Tools and Techniques Course. 
If a person would like to actually run the program, you'd need a db_config.yaml file with your Neo4J credentials and to locate the CSV file from the State of NY's free database. Also would need a Tableau License.
